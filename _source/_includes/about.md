I am a member of the Terpenoid Group at Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences at the University of Copenhagen.
I'm interested in discovering chemical pathways in medicinal plants for producing diterpenoids.
The idea is that we find the genes that are in the pathway and then engineer the pathway into an alternative host organism that can produce the chemical in a more efficient manner.
